# cd into the base dir

# run
npm install
npm run dev

cd backend
# run

composer install
composer update
# to install composer packages that the backend is dependent on

# then time for the migrations

# make a copy .env.example and rename it to .env
# make sure you have a mysql db with the corresponding name inside your new .env file
# or uncomment the sqlite db config that wil work on the fly

# next, run migrations, seed your db with the sample model factories and then artisan serve the app
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed
php artisan serve

# to test the available backend unit tests of the Task and Project Controllers,
# run
php artisan test --filter TaskControllerTest
php artisan test --filter ProjectControllerTest

# alternatively, you can run all the unit tests in one go
# run
# php artisan test 
# the above line will test the Auth tests generated by laravel breeze, and the Task and Project tests too

# After running these tests, please seed the db again since each test refreshes the db
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
